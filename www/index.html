The features currently being worked on are: </p>     <ul>   <li>Method, Field &amp; Constructor literals (part of <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddhp95vd_0f7mcns">First Class Methods</a>)<br /></li><li><a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/forax/archive/2007/09/mixing_property_1.html">Properties</a>  (and property literals)</li><li><a href="http://freddy33.blogspot.com/2007/05/why-java-enum-cannot-extends.html">Abstract Enums</a></li><li><a href="http://www.jroller.com/jadda/entry/meta_interfaces_revisited">Static Implements / Contracts</a> <br /></li>   </ul>     <p> This effort is run independently of Sun, and no warranty is given on the quality of the changes made to javac. However, we do try and keep the code changes minimal, and as such we hope that all existing Java programs will still compile. </p>     <p> This project is similar to <a href="http://ksl.dev.java.net">KSL</a>, however there are a few differences. This project will not require code reviews by compiler experts, or the signing of legal documents. It is simply a place where those who want to change Java for the better can come together and demonstrate their idea for real.</p><p>If you have a great idea for a language change that you want to code, why not join us? Simply subscribe to the <a href="https://kijaro.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">dev mailing list</a>   and let us know so we can open up a branch.<br /></p>   <h3>Rules</h3>  <p>There are just a few rules to try and keep everything going:</p> <ul> <li>Documentation. Each new language feature must have <em>some</em> form of associated document, even if its just a blog. It doesn't have to be much, but should have an outline of why the feature is needed and the syntax implications.</li> <li>Backwards compatibility. On svn trunk all existing Java code must compile.</li> <li>Comments. Each change in svn trunk must have a comment so we can find it later, such as 'FCM-MREF'.</li> <li>er, thats about it!<br /> </li> </ul> <h3>Developer information<br /></h3> <p>Kijaro is based on Sun OpenJDK javac, currently from jdk7-b23, which is contained in a <a href="https://kijaro.dev.java.net/svn/kijaro/sun/">vendor branch</a>. Unless the OpenJDK version contains major changes that we need, it is unlikely that this version will be updated in the near future.</p><p>Each subproject will use a separate <a href="https://kijaro.dev.java.net/svn/kijaro/branches/">branch</a>. Subversion trunk will contain the merged changes.</p><p>The compiler is built using the standard ant script in the make directory. To get this to work, you can follow these <a href="https://kijaro.dev.java.net/svn/kijaro/branches/fcm/langtools/BUILDING.txt">build instructions</a>.</p><p>The resulting compiler can be used in place of a normal compiler. The compiler build will create a javac unix shell file. Windows users can use <a href="https://kijaro.dev.java.net/svn/kijaro/branches/fcm/examples/javac.bat">this batch file</a>.</p><p>IDE integration files may be checked into subversion, and we would welcome such submissions.<br /></p>                                 <h3>'Kijaro'</h3> <p>Kijaro is short for Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain. We hope that this project can take Java to new heights too!</p>
