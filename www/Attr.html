<h3>Attr</h3>
<p>
The Attr class is the 'attribution' phase of compilation, which is perhaps the most complicated.
Its principle task is to determine what the identifiers mean.
Thus, for example, 'String' will be resolved to an object representing the String type, as opposed to
a variable or method named String.
</p>
<p>
Attr follows the standard visitor pattern.
Within each visitor, any types or identifiers are worked on.
This document describes some of the common classes faced.
</p>
<p>
There are a variety of classes representing types, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeSymbol - The symbol for a type, corresponding relatively closely with the source level view.</li>
<li>Type - The compiler level view of a type, with many subclasses:</li>
<li>BottomType - Represents null.</li>
<li>ClassType - Represents classes and interfaces, together with any type variables.
The type variables will be a ClassType if known, such as 'Set<String>', or a TypeVar if unknown, such as 'Set<T>'.</li>
<li>ArrayType - Represents arrays, such as 'String[]'.</li>
<li>MethodType - Represents a method, constructor or initializer.</li>
<li>ForAllType - Represents a method called with explicit type variables, such as 'ListUtils.<String>create()'.</li>
<li>PackageType - Represents packages.</li>
<li>WildcardType - Represents the type variable '?', which may also have bounds, such as '? extends Number'.</li>
<li>TypeVar - Represents a type variable 'T' or 'T extends Number'.</li>
<li>CapturedType - Subclass of type variable used when the type variable is captured from a wildcard.</li>
<li>UndetVar - Represents an undetermined type variable during type inference.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Within the visitor method, access is provided to many values, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>names - The setof pre-defined names.</li>
<li>syms - The set of pre-defined symbols.</li>
<li>types - Utilities for working with types.</li>
<li>rs - The resolver, providing utility methods to find program elements.</li>
<li>pt - The proto-type, representing the type that the expression is assigned to.
For example, when processing the RHS of an assign statement, the proto-type represents the LHS.</li>
</ul>
