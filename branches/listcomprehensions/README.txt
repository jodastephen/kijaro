README for Kijaro
=================

Kijaro provides a place for Java language changes to be tried.

All code here is without warranty of any kind.
We will, of course, try and ensure quality and backwards compatibility.
However, it is not our intent for this code to be used directly in production systems.

The project is written as changes to an original version of javac (from OpenJDK 7-b23).
The license of this project is therefore GPL with classpath extension.

All changes are copyrighted to their new author irrespective of the copyright
statements in the source file.
