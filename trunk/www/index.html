The features currently being worked on are: </p>     <ul>   <li>Method literals</li>   </ul>     <p> This effort is run independently of Sun, and no warranty is given on the quality of the changes made to javac. However, we do try and keep the code changes minimal, and as such we hope that all existing Java programs will still compile. </p>     <p> This project is similar to <a href="http://ksl.dev.java.net">KSL</a>, however there are a few differences. This project will not require code reviews by compiler experts, or the signing of legal documents. It is simply a place where those who want to change Java for the better can come together and demonstrate their idea for real. </p>   <h3>Rules</h3>  <p>There are just a few rules to try and keep everything going:</p> <ul> <li>Documentation. Each new language feature must have <em>some</em> form of associated document, even if its just a blog. It doesn't have to be much, but should have an outline of why the feature is needed and the syntax implications.</li> <li>Backwards compatibility. On svn TRUNK all existing Java code must compile.</li> <li>Comments. Each change must have a comment so we can find it later, such as 'FCM-MREF'.</li> <li>er, thats about it!<br /> </li> </ul> <h3>'Kijaro'</h3> <p>Kijaro is short for Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain. We hope that this project can take Java to new heights too!</p>
